# AI Context

This document gives AI assistants and new contributors a safe, high-level map of the project.

Do not include secrets here. Never paste values from `.env`, Supabase keys, service-role keys, real credentials, or private user data into documentation, prompts, commits, or issues.

## Project Summary

IRRIDELTA is a React + Vite single-page app for a business website with:

- Public pages for home, products, about, branches, and contact.
- Supabase-backed product and category management.
- Supabase Auth-based login.
- Role-based routes for clients and admins.
- Learning content for clients: capacitaciones and certificaciones.
- Admin panels for products, capacitaciones, and certificaciones.

## Stack

- React 18
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- React Router
- Zustand for session state
- Supabase JS client
- ESLint

## Important Paths

- `src/App.jsx`: main routing and protected route logic.
- `src/supabaseClient.js`: Supabase browser client using Vite env variables.
- `src/store/sessionStore.js`: current user/session/role state.
- `src/utils/authRoles.js`: app role detection from Supabase Auth metadata.
- `src/context/ProductContext.jsx`: product/category CRUD logic.
- `src/services/learningContentService.js`: learning content, modules, resources, files, and certification persistence.
- `src/components/AdminLearningManager.jsx`: admin UI for capacitaciones.
- `src/components/LearningCatalog.jsx`: client-facing capacitaciones catalog.
- `src/pages/AdminCertificaciones.jsx`: admin UI for final certifications.
- `src/pages/CertificationExam.jsx`: client certification exam flow.

## Auth And Roles

The app treats authenticated users as `cliente` by default.

Admins are detected through Supabase Auth user metadata:

```txt
app_metadata.role = "admin"
```

The frontend role check only controls navigation and UI access. Supabase Row Level Security policies must still enforce real database permissions.

## Learning Domain

Current learning model:

- A `capacitacion` is the parent training item.
- A capacitacion has one or more `capacitacion_modulos`.
- Each module can contain multiple `modulo_recursos`.
- Resources can be files or YouTube links.
- A `certificacion` is one final evaluation associated with a capacitacion.

Business rules:

- A capacitacion must have at least one module.
- Modules are created manually.
- Files and YouTube links can be mixed in the same module.
- Allowed MVP file extensions: `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`, `xlsx`, `jpg`, `png`, `mp4`.
- No resource reuse is implemented.
- No upload progress is implemented.
- Certificate PDF generation is not implemented.

## Current Implementation Notes

The capacitaciones admin flow currently saves the parent training item and then replaces the module/resource rows for that training item. This is simple and acceptable for MVP scale.

If this grows, consider moving multi-step database writes into a Supabase RPC/Postgres function so the database changes can be transactional. Storage uploads still need careful cleanup/rollback behavior because object storage and database writes are not one atomic operation.

## Safety Rules For Future AI Work

- Do not read, print, summarize, or commit `.env` values.
- Do not expose Supabase anon keys, service-role keys, auth tokens, emails, or real credentials.
- Do not commit `.env`, `.env.admin.local`, or generated secrets.
- Keep RLS and Storage policies versioned when possible so the database setup is reproducible.
- Prefer small, focused changes and verify with targeted lint/build commands.
- Do not change certification logic unless the task explicitly asks for it.
- When editing learning content, preserve the relationship between capacitaciones, modules, resources, and final certifications.
