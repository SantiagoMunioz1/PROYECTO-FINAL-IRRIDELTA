# Learning Modules

This document explains the capacitaciones feature for future contributors and AI assistants.

## Goal

Capacitaciones support multiple manually created modules. Each module can contain multiple resources, including mixed files and YouTube links.

Certificaciones remain separate: one final evaluation can be associated with a capacitacion.

## User Experience

Admin users can:

- Manage capacitaciones from a separate list page and enter a focused editor for one item.
- Create a capacitacion with title and description.
- Save a capacitacion as draft or mark it as published.
- Add one or more modules.
- Keep working with one mandatory module minimum in the form.
- Add a title and optional description to each module.
- Upload multiple files per module.
- Add multiple YouTube links per module.
- Mix files and YouTube links in the same module.
- Remove selected files before saving.
- Remove existing resources while editing.
- Collapse or expand each module independently without losing unsaved form data.
- Edit one required module test per module.
- Edit one required final evaluation per capacitacion.
- See whether each module is complete or pending and why.
- Preview a capacitacion inside the admin panel without leaving the current page.
- Receive a warning before leaving if there are unsaved changes.

Client users can:

- View published capacitaciones only.
- See modules in order.
- Open file resources.
- Open YouTube resources.
- View published final certifications only.

## Data Flow

Admin form state is built in `src/components/AdminLearningManager.jsx`.

Persistence is handled in `src/services/learningContentService.js`.

High-level save flow:

1. Validate capacitacion title.
2. Validate at least one module.
3. Validate module titles.
4. Validate each module test.
5. Validate the required final evaluation.
6. Validate allowed file extensions.
7. Save the parent capacitacion row, including `publicada`.
8. Replace module and resource rows for that capacitacion.
9. Upload new files to Supabase Storage.
10. Insert module resource rows with file or YouTube metadata.
11. Upsert the final certification row linked to the capacitacion.

## Resource Types

Current resource types:

- `archivo`
- `youtube`

The value is stored in `modulo_recursos.tipo`.

## Allowed File Types

MVP file extensions:

- `pdf`
- `docx`
- `pptx`
- `xlsx`
- `jpg`
- `png`
- `mp4`

These are defined in `learningContentService.js` and reused by the admin UI.

## Known Tradeoffs

The current implementation replaces module and resource rows during edits. This keeps the code simpler, but it is not ideal for high-volume production usage.

The admin preview modal intentionally reuses the same shared preview card as the public catalog. This reduces duplicated markup and helps keep admin preview and client-facing output visually consistent.

Module collapse state is UI-only. It is not persisted to the database and resets when the admin form is rebuilt.

The current admin editor warns before leaving when there are unsaved changes. This protection currently covers in-app navigation triggers used by the editor plus browser refresh and close.

Potential future improvements:

- Use a database RPC for transactional multi-table writes.
- Add upload progress.
- Add file size limits.
- Add better rollback and cleanup for partial upload failures.
- Split `AdminLearningManager` into smaller components.
- Add resource ordering controls in the UI.
- Add pagination or lazy loading if content volume grows.

## Do Not Do Unless Requested

- Do not implement resource reuse.
- Do not generate PDF certificates automatically.
- Do not change certification exam logic unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Do not expose environment values or Supabase secrets in docs or code.
